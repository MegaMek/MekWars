Using links in MOTDs

Due to security/stability problems with MOTDs, I've implemented 
an HTML sanitizer.  One side-effect of this is that link handling 
has changed.

If you wish to put a link to a web server in, you must include
the "http" in the url:

This will work:
<a href="http://www.mekwars.org/forum">Forum</a>

This, however, will not:
<a href="www.mekwars.org/forum">Forum</a>

If you wish to include a JUMPTOPLANET link, you have to use
a custom planet tag:

This will work:
<planet name="Misery">Misery</planet>

This, however, will not, even though it was proper form until this
version:
<a href="JUMPTOPLANETMisery">Misery</a>
