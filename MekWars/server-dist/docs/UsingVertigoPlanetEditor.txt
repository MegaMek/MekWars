known issues:
Removing all terrains isn't working, so remove them one at a time
changing percents on terrains isn't working, so just remove and re-add them to change the percentages, you don't have to actually end up at 100%, the display will show the correct percent as a portion of the available percents used (ie if you set one terrain at 30, and another at 10, then stop they will display as 75% and 25% respectively)
