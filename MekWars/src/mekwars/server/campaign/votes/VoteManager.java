 * The VoteManager controls all vote casting and counting for a campaign.
 * 
 * Current implementation uses phenomenally inefficient vector sorting
 * and doesnt save its contents. At some point, McWizard will change this
 * to use Hibernate and make it not suck. =)
 * 
 * Houses and players use the VoteManager to get access to information they
 * need. Lists of outstanding votes, player vote totals, etc. So long as these
 * calls are duplicated when the VM is Hibernated, and return vote vectors, nothing
 * in SHouse or SPlayer should be broken by the transition.
