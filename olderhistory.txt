* Also, please note that while I've fixed the customize      *
* screen for Aeros, it still puts us in the position of a    *
* player being able to customize things that are not allowed *
* by BT rules - they should not be able to set RapidFire MGs *
* or non-standard ammo.  I'll fix that next release, but     *

+ Save the component, flu and price mods to pricemods.dat file instead of in
  the standard faction.dats. Save mechanism is slapdash and should probably be
  changed to be more efficient. Saving outside the usual string will make this
  easier to adjust at a later date, then incorporate into the normal saves.
- Removed support for old-style faction saves (monolithic houses.dat file).
+ Show costs in tooltip text when hovering over a factory in CHSPanel.
+ Do NOT reset faction timestamp after every conquer, as nothing relevant to
  the bin in & bin out sequence is changed when a world is modified.
+ Bump faction timestamp when conq status changed w/ SetHouseConquer cmd.
+ Bump faction timestamp when comp mod is set w/ AdminSetHouseCompMod cmd.
+ Bump faction timestamp when flu mod is set w/ AdminSetHouseFluMod cmd.
+ Bump faction timestamp when price mod is set w/ AdminSetHousePriceMod cmd.
+ Bump faction timestamp when logo is set w/ SetHouseLogo cmd.
+ Bump faction timestamp when color is set w/ ChangeHouseColor cmd.
+ RFE: Ability to set an influence mod, like the component and price mods
  already available, for unit purchases on a house by house basis.
+ New command, /c AdminSatHouseFluModCommand.java. Identical to pricemod cmd.
+ Moved client-side .getPriceForUnit(), .getInfluenceForUnit() and
  .getPPForUnit(). Were non-static methods in CPlayer. Are now static methods
  in CUnit. Used in HS panel and by online help.
+ Moved isInHouseAttacks from House to SHouse and removed from binin and
  binout. Not used by any client-side code.
+ Moved initialHouseRanking from House to SHouse and removed from binin and
  binout. Not used by any client-side code.
+ Moved motd from House to SHouse. Sent by server @ signin, not through the
  binin and binout data streams.
+ BUG: NPE attempting to load planetOpsFlags.dat. Check to see if file exists
  and skip the load attempt if it is missing or empty.

v 0.1.44.x (Closed 10.17.06, no binary release)
+ RFE: Money/flu/component multipliers applied to purchases from factories not
  originally owned by the player's faction. Defaults are set to 1.0, which does
  not change cost. GUI to set is in ServerCongigDialog's Units2 tab.
+ RFE: Only auto-produce units from factories originally owned by a faction.
+ RFE: Peg factory purchase cost to original faction instead of current owner.
+ New MM Jar with SB and Munitions patch and TW rules.
+ Deds attempt to sign on much more slowly after a connectionLost(). This does
  not stop "rogue" behaviour when two instances of a single ded are running at
  the same time, but makes it possible for owners to actually shot one down.
R Client 0.1.44.8
+ BUG: Deds buffering all commands b/c they never have a CMainFrame. I'm dumb.
+ Better logging of startHost() failures when deds first sign on to servers.
+ RFE: Total BV's in /c modgame blocks, w/ finishing values for complete games.
R Client 0.1.44.7 / Server 0.1.44.7
+ BUG: Deds not forwarding DSD and USD commands to standard parseData().
+ BUG: Transferring a linked C3 Master could cause concurrent mod error.
R Client 0.1.44.6.
+ Changed place where saved mail request is issued, in the hope that it will
  fix the "PM Splash Crash" TT users are experiencing with Client 0.1.44.5.
R Client 0.1.44.5 / Server 0.1.44.6
+ Incoming data (as directed to MWClient.doParseDataInput) checked and stored
  if the main frame is null. Only data commands (USD, DSD) are allowed to
  proceed normally. Other commands are processed en block after CMainFrame is
  constructed. This stops NPE's, but makes the client open more slowly.
+ Moved main frame construction block in MWClient.java. Is now built after the
  chat connection opens and serverconfig.txt is fetched, to stop NPE's.
+ BUG: Infinite splash screen for any user who connects w/o a local copy of
  the campaignconfig.txt. Values from campaignconfig were being requested
  before a connection to the server was opened in order to fetch them, leading
  to a null MainFrame and unending splash.
+ BUG: Impossible for a new user to log into campaign. Server wasn't allowing
  /c getserverconfig to pass through and execute unless the issuing player was
  logged in by SignOn.java, making it impossible for an unenrolled user to get
  the campaignconfig.txt.
R Server 0.1.44.5
+ BUG: impossible to buy from worlds your faction controls.
R Client 0.1.44.4 / Server 0.1.44.4
0 N 0.1.44.1-44.3 in history, but 44.3 is CVS & on Sol7, so this is 0.1.44.4.
+ RFE: Include duration of games in the resultsLog.
+ RFE: Show duration of games in /c modgames output.
+ RFE 1552224: Ability to not show players' names in Tick Reports. Two new
  options in ServerConfig's Faction tab. Uncheck to use faction names in place
  of player names in tick report, news feed entries, or both.
- Removed CUnit.getWeightclassName(). Dupe of Unit.getWeightClassDesc()
- Removed CUnit(CCampaign c) constructor. Unused.
- Removed PL|PD and CPlayer.setPlayerData(String s). Seems to be an unused dupe
  of the PS| & CPlayer.setData(String s) pair.
- Removed Army.hasMoreInfantryThanElse() & replaced some enums w/ iterators.
+ BUG: Mezzo ignored when requesting a unit. Feature and associated classes
  removed instead of being fixed, as no Server Op used or wants the feature.
+ BUG: Status icons where not showing a place for Repair/Maintenace
  when in !dynamic mode.
+ BUG: visibilty for ops was using its own variable to calculate itself
+ BUG: OpponentListHelper caused an inf loop of people that were active
  had more then one army. The sort Arraylist was using its own size as an
  attribute in the For statment and adding to itself while in the for loop.
+ Release Server/Client 0.1.44.0
+ added new MM.jar MegaMek 0.31.14-MW09212006-4827

+ RFE: Visibility is broken into 2 halfs for the RNG to create a bell curve
+ RFE: FFA games that have only 2 players in them have players start on
  opposite ends of the board like normal 2 player games.
+ BUG: FFA games where more then one person per house was in it would cause a
  null to be listed instead of the number of players.
+ BUG: game visibility was going below min visibilty, due to dusk and night
  fights
+ Streamlined RequestCommand. Support for old-style MMNET SOL requests wasn't
  needed anymore. NOTE: There appears to be a bug in RequestCommand which leads
  to mezzo/pricemods being ignored. More changes to the file are forthcoming.
+ Added to code to move Server Campaign Config data so that it is transfered
  via the chat port vs data port. First step removing data port.
+ BUG: Engine repair not working in bulk dialog.
- Removed cheatlog.X. Entries duped in modlog.X, making cheatlog superfluous.
+ RFE: Show use of StripUnits and DeleteAccount in mod channel.
+ Replaced usages of Boolean.valueOf(String s).booleanValue() with Java 1.5's
  Boolean.parseBoolean(String s). More compact code, and less autoboxing.
- Removed CUnit.getUnitString(). Unused.
- Removed CUnit.setUnitData(String). Unused.
+ On-Line help for unit status icons
+ Replaced all instances of "Vacant" with hasVacantPilot checks.
+ added hasVacantPilot to Unit.java
+ Added new icons to client-dist
+ RFE: Use icons instead of colors for unit status
+ Client support of options below. Sell buttons and menu choices disabled as
  appropriate (Clan & BMNoSell checked). Bid button turned off if BMNoBuy.
+ Admin config menu support of options below.
+ RFE: Option to block sell-side BM access to specified factions.
+ RFE: Option to block buy-side BM access to specified factions.
+ RFE: Option to block sales of Clan-tech units on BM.
- Removed House.mayUseBM and House.isMayUseBM() in favor of the more
  granular server options described above. This breaks data compat.
- Removed "Hibernate" server option default value.

v 0.1.43.x
+ Yet more OLH issues. I really screwd the pooch on this one. @urgru :-(
+ BUG: Out of bounds error in OpponentListHelper.
+ BUG: ClassCastException in OpponentListHelper.

Release Server 0.1.43.1
+ New MM.jar 0.31.15-MW09122006-4827
+ BUG: Repod using case to determine matches. Switched to case insensitive.
+ New MM.jar 0.31.15-MW09112006
+ Remove unnecessary code
+ BUG: fix NPE when resolving ops with auto-added arty.
+ BUG: Players not being removed after unenrolling. Unenroll now checks to see
  if a player has units under repair and should be safe, but the DeleteAccount
  command may still fail on players with repairung units.
+ BUG: Opponent lists being built improperly after cancellation of games.
- Removed ShortValidator.genericAbleToDefend and OpponentListHelper.matches.
  Folded funtionality into OpponentListHelper.getOpponentsForAll(). This
  eliminated lots of duplicative checks (activity, sameip, etc).
Release client/server 0.1.43.0

+ BUG: ProtMek pilots becoming mek pilots
+ BUG 1555816: customizing A4 unit NPE 0.1.42.0

+ BUG 1553466: OP Editor
+ Modified many static references to use statics from an ultimate parent class
  (eg - Unit instead of SUnit when using .LIGHT or .FOR_SALE).
+ More small refactors (foreach loops, direct access to statics, etc).
+ SHouse no longer defined as an abstract class.
- Removed SHouse.NORMALHOUSE, SHouse.MERCHOUSE, SHouse.NONCONQHOUSE and
  SHouse.NEWBIEHOUSE. Static variables were only used to set factionType.

- Removed SHouse.factionType variable and related subclass methods.
+ Tweaks to SHouse and CBattlePanel (unneeded casts, improved for loops, etc)
+ Many more refactors, mostly small, involving loops, generics, and other
  warnings being thrown in Eclipse 3.2 that weren't caught in 3.1.
- Removed CampaignMain.getHouseForPlanet(Planet p). Was unused.
- Removed CampaignMain.getPlanetInfo(String s). Was unused.

v 0.1.42.x

v 0.1.41.x
- Ran Eclipse Clean-up Wizard to remove unused imports, unused local variables
  and unnecessary casts. Also added Java 1.5 @Override comments to all methods
  that override those of superclasses (including generic java.lang.Object).
- Removed MWChatClient.setAttribute() and getAttribute(). Were unused.
- Removed MWChatClient.equals() and MWChatClient.hashCode(). Both were simple
  pass throughs to superclass methods. No unique code/capability.

R Server 0.1.41.4
+ BUG: Exploit allowing users to set arbitrary levels.
+ RFE 1535927: Transmit Pilot Details when Transfer to Factionmate
+ RFE 1545928: status color for meks w/o pilots. is a light/washed out green.
+ BUG: Possible to defend AFR while vacant units are in armies.
R Client 0.1.41.1 / Server 0.1.41.3
- Removed support for eras. Unecessary code complication. Tables should be in
  /standard (factory production), /rare (BM production) and /reward (from RP)
  folders. Welfare.txt belongs in /standard.
+ Add warnings to errlog.0 when reading planets.xml that has TIMEZONE fields.
- Removed "ProductionTable" var from UnitFactory and subclasses. Unused MMNET
  remnant. After 2-3 widespread releases, should be able to re-use its token.
+ RFE: Deds no longer connect to data port.
+ BUG: Deds receiving GUI messages boxes, which keep them from reconnecting to
  a server after a crash.
R Server 0.1.41.2
+ BUG: ShortResolver.calculatePilotEXP() did not convert ownerName to
  lowercase, so name could not be found.
R Client/Server 0.1.41.1
+ RFE: Move Game Status to the Games menu
+ BUG: issue with customize unit dialog GUI when trying reload/switch ammo.
+ BUG: setunitammocommand sending incorrect link to pay for the new ammo.
R Client/Server 0.1.41.0
+ New MegaMek 0.1.31.11-MW08142006; Improved Hotloading and fixes to shields.
+ Change code for hotloading ammo.
  NOTE: due to the hotloading being a flag in the units ammo.
  Units with ammo will throw errors the first time they are loaded
  This will only cause a minor loss of damage and customizations
  i.e. slite targetting ammo selections. A Necessary Evil --Torren
+ BUG: NPE when reloading One Shot weapons

v 0.1.40.x
R Client/Server 0.1.40.0
+ New MegaMek 0.31.10-MW08122006 Has MPod patch and Hotload code
+ Added hotloading settings to customize unit dialog
+ RFE 1536881: Loading Ammo can be Confusing
+ added ShortReslover.calculatePilotEXP() Now pilots get exp even if their
  unit is salavage or destoryed. Pilots only can level if they win and their
  unit survives the game.
+ Pilots were not getting EXP from FFA games if they lost but had kills.
+ Pilots were not getting EXP from DRAW games.

v 0.1.39.x
R Client 0.1.39.1 / Server 0.1.39.1
+ BUG: Damage being applied in games with "NoDestructionMode" enabled.
- Removed SetUnitRepairCommand. Replaced by direct polling of servers.
+ BUG 1528347: In OOM situation, mwconfig.txt is replaced with 0 length fil
+ Repodcommand didn't transfer targetting type or slite status.
+ Added support for "MaxBMSalesTicks" and "MaxBMSalesPrice" in defaults, Sell
  and ServerConfigDialog. Bids can be higher than max asking price. Defaults
  are 100 ticks and 999,999 money.
- Removed MMServ.getProtocolVersion. Was called only from an unused method.
- Removed MMServ.serverStarted(). Was unused.
- Removed MMServ.nameExists(String s). Was unused.
+ Did several ticky-tack TODO's (global announce of faction mutes, etc.)
- Removed client.MMGame. Both client and server should use common.MMGame.
- Removed SaveCampaignCommand.java Functional dupe of AdminSaveCommand.java.
+ MekWarsAutoUpdate 0.7
+ BUG: issue when creating a manifest on a windows machine and moving it to
  a unix box. IIS is smart enough to convert \ to /, so Unix didn't need to.
+ BUG 1528335: /c modgames not showing compositions if blind drop enabled.
+ BUG: Coloration only matches games when battles tab is sorted by name.
+ BUG: Battles Tab not showing max players.
R Client/Server 0.1.39.0
+ Removed some warnings
+ BUG: AT pilots not always remembering when they fought in a unit. Now units
  remember the pilot ids. AT can ride in multiple units and still repair them
  until someone else takes them into combat.
+ RFE: added MinNumberOfPlayers variable for FFA operations. Default 3
+ Bug removing certain units from their owners in Market2.removeListing().
+ Significant rewrite of Battles tab and host handling. Biggest differences for
  users will be ability to sort (a la BM) and fixes to color scheme (full games
  red, deds yellow when games start, etc). Tested locally and works reasonably
  well, but still has some issues properly tracking who is in a server.
- Removed Calc Battle. Not enough people use it to justify fixing the current
  version. Users are welcome to repair the old code and submit new patch.
- Removed NotifyCommand.java, was a dupe of ServerAnnouncementCommand.
- Removed server side support for "RG" command. Was never sent.
- Removed support for "SOUNDONHOST".
+ BUG: Error drawing BM tab if unit sent w/o model name. Send a blank space.
+ Include autoreported games in resultslog.
+ Removed player counts from reports.

v 0.1.38.x (Closed 7.29.06, No SF Release)
+ BUG: NPE in SPlanet if oldOwner is null.

R Server 0.1.38.2
+ BUG: NPE while processing salvage.
+ BUG: Never ending immunity expiration messages.
R Client 0.1.38.1 / Server 0.1.38.1
+ RFE 1524881: SOL Defection Unit Change. (Works in 3025 era ONLY!)
+ RFE: units left over in the Newbie house bays at startup will get placed back
  on to the market using the vaules for Rare unit sales.
+ BUG: GC while back up occured was causing errors. Back now runs during the
  Tick instead of as a thread launched from the tick.
+ BUG: Rare and Faction_ units were not being removed if auctions ended and
  they did not sell.
+ BUG 1526629: BM bug
+ BUG 1523255: PPQ bug
+ Added new Command AdminUpdateClientParam this will allow Admins to do what 
  The serverdata.dat does but while players are on-line. One more win for big
  brother -- Torren
+ Added client version to Ded Ping command
+ Added New Ded Command setUpdateURL
+ Added New Ded Command getUpdateURL
R Client/Server 0.1.38.0
+ BUG: Advance repair erroring while trying to report critical hits.

v 0.1.37.x (Closed 07.17.06, No SF Release)
+ BUG: issue with creating manifest file via mwautoupdate format was wrong.
R Client/Server 0.1.37.0 ( For Solaris 7 to test FFA fixes on)
+ New command: /c adminspoof#issuingplayer#commandname#[command options]. Hard
  locked such that only admins can issue. Command level CANNOT be reduced. The
  spoof command allows admins to issue ANY command in a player's stead. Should
  be used exceedingly sparingly, and only when no actual admin command for a
  function exists (ex: to ofrcibly change a user's logo image).
- Removed COMMTABSCOLOR from CConfig.java. Wasn't checked in client code.
+ No more dedicated prefixes. Were silly, as deds only respond to PM's now.
+ Added MM 0.31.9-MW7122006 Has Heatcutoff and /victory /defeat fixes in it.
+ Hosts/Deds now report games instead of players.
+ Stream Lined GO command so that it will now take MM game options without 
  having to hard code in each variable name.

v 0.1.36.x (Closed 07.14.06No SF Release)
+ Replaced config dialog's DEDPREFIX field w/ a DEDAUTORESTART field.
+ Clarified army naming. Specifically, how to REMOVE a name or set no name.
- Removed "Send House Mail" menu option. So far as I can tell, a grand total
  of ZERO people use this. Can be restored if someone actually wants it. :-(
- Removed some old values from CConfig.
- Removed colors Campign menu support.
+ BUG: RegisterCommand did not set save flag for Player file.
- Removed Check for on going operations in UpdateOperationsCommand.java
- Removed common.CampaignData.binHouseBannedAmmoIn, along with common.House's
  HouseBannedAmmoOut and HouseBannedAmmoIn. Dataprovider used instead of bin.
- Removed common.TaskInfo.java. Unused remnant of MMNET's task system.
- Removed common.PlanetEnvironment.equivalent(). Old MMNET code that was both
  unused and useless. Attempted to compare Strings using == instead of .equals,
  so it would have always returned false if it were used.
- Removed unused fromString-style constructor from common.MMClientInfo.
- Removed common.ConfigOptions. Class was totally devoid of content O_o
- Removed common.util.StringConverter. Moved some method into StringUtils.
- Removed common.comm.ChatListener.java/ Was unused. Appears to be a remnant
  of the original dedicated server code, which listened for commands in chat.
+ Replaced some Vectors with ArrayLists in CPersonalPilotQueues, CPlayer, and
  misc. classes that use CPlayer's data. Hangar and Armies retain vectors. Tech
  info and excludes moved into arraylists.
+ Replaced HashTables with TreeMaps in CHSPanel and Map's IconCache. 
+ RFE: Break ImmunityThread out of SPlayer and use one master ImmunityThread
  instead of an individual thread for each immune player.
+ RFE: Show player's market sales in /c mystatus and /c adminplayertstatus.
+ Admins should have access to CheckArmyLink all the time, but everyone else
  should only be able to use it on armies that are already fighting.
- Removed MWChatServer.Constants.java. Unused collection of static ints.
- Removed a constructor from SMWLogger. While it's nice to offer an option to
  use other dirs to store logs, there's no config option support.  :-)
- Removed MWChatServer.broadcastSignOffToUsers(), broadCastSignOnToUsers(),
  getUserCount(), and getUptime(). All unused. Also made PingThread static.
- Removed MMServ.writeToLog(). Remnant of ancient logging system.
- Removed client.dedicated.command.* pacakge. Discrete dedicated commands are
  no not used. See MWClient.parseDedDataInput() for ALL current ded controls.
+ Replace all use of StringBuffers with StringBuilers, which are new in Java5.
  Builders aren't synchronized and should be faster. Safe b/c we don't ever
  generate Strings using input from multiple threads simultaneously.
- Removed vestigal NewsChannel code from CCommPanel. MMNET hold over.
- Removed UF-style (curr BV, ratio, etc) info from MechDetailDisplay.
+ Finalized MWClient statics. Removed option to set gui command prefix.
- Removed CCommPanel.changeStatus(). Was used in waaay ancient MMNET times to
  block access to house chat while logged out. This is no longer needed.
- Removed CPlayer.addUnit(). Was unused. New units added using PL|HD. This is
  non-intuitive. See CPlayer.setHangarData() and SPlayer.addUnit() comments.
- Removed CPlayer.addArmy() and various support methods it called. Superceded
  by PL|SAD and CPlayer.setArmyData().
- Removed all support for client side ./campaign.player.dat file. Completely
  superfluous and unused b/c of server side autologin. Deleted LoginGCCmd and
  CPlayer's saveData(), loadData(), getHangarString(), getPlayerString() and
  clearData() methods. 
- Removed CCampaign.clearData(), loadHouseData(), loadPlanetData()
+ Renamed Unit.getModelname() to checkModelName() and switched all all server
  side uses of the Unit method to SUnit's getModelName(), which is better.
+ Added generics to PilotQueue Vectors and LinkedLists.
+ Factored PilotQueues.listDispossessedPilot code into AdminHousePilots.
+ Reworked BuildTable.java. No more static constructor or self-refential
  static accesses. All hashtables, etc. now contained w/i individual methods.
+ Use disputed color in SPlanet descriptions instead of black, where possible.
+ Changed several classes to explicitly close file input and streams after
  reading or writing files. Will do this in other classes as noticed.
+ Changed several classed to use StingBuffer or StringBuilder in lieu of looped
  String concatenation. Will do this in other places as noticed.
+ Make CampaignMain a final class. Subclassing would result in errors b/c
  the super() constructor would start threads before subclass construction.
+ Check for null and empty lines in CampaignMain.loadFactionData().
- Removed MMServ.cleanup() and .removeBadChars(). Were unused.
- Removed CampaignMain.getCurrentTick() Unused.
- Removed SHouse.potentialHouseProduction(). Unused. MMNET remnant.
+ BUG: Still possible to kick admins. Oops.
+ BUG: NPE in ShortResolver. Attempting to get HS|RU string for null unit. 
+ BUG: HS| updates not being sent when faction takes complete control of
  previously contested world.
- Removed old planet code that described relative position ("Near the border
  and subject to frequent raiding from YYY"). Bloat, as nearly all people use
  the visible map instead of /c planet to get target hints.
+ Use regexp \s+ to find and replace all multi-spaces with single spaces when
  loading build tables. This lets ops format things more legibly.
R Client 0.1.36.1 / Server 0.1.36.1
+ Move production logs from mainlog to infolog.
+ Add modmail to modlog in ModeratorMailCommand instead of CampaignMain's
  .doSendModMail(). Most commands add directly to the modlog, making logs
  of non-user-chat modmail duplicative.
+ Exclude various mail and messaging commands from cmdlog.0.
+ Removed debug output in ExclusionList
+ Added MM 0.31.9-MW6292006
+ Added Victory Conditions Code from MM to Operations an Operations Editor.
R Client/Server 0.1.36.0
+ BUG 1474353: ejected and picked up mechwarrior does not survive
+ BUG 1483315: Failed autoreports

v 0.1.35.x(Closed 6.27.06. No SF Release)
R Client 0.1.35.2 / Server 0.1.35.3
+ BUG 1511467: Astech not working when using standard repairs.
+ BUG: NPE's possible in /me, /mm, /hm and /incharacter if sent with no text.
+ "Faction Colors" in lieu of "House Colors" in config dialog for consistancy.
+ RFE: make it impossible to kick or ban admins.
+ BUG: should do disconnect check BEFORE logging out kicked/banned players.
R Server 0.1.35.2
+ BUG: /me broken, sent emotes only to player who issued command.
+ RFE: Remove activity counts from /c players if status is hidden. Continue
  printing all info for own faction and for server admins. Showing the counts
  was an old practice that doesn't make much sense on current servers.
+ BUG: Sending winner HS updates to losing house in some situations. oops :-(
+ Added FileChooser instead of FileDialog to MWAutoupdater. This was only the
  a folder has to be selected instead of a file.
+ Added a new method to AorAn. Renamed class to StringUtils.
+ Lots of small string changes. Far fewer "has been" and "have been"'s now.
+ Possible fix for "Cancellation Ghosts." Don't return players to active status
  if they have disco threads that don't have playerReturned == true.
R Client/Server 0.1.35.1
+ Added MM 0.31.9-MW6152006
+ Change timestamp for server side data to only be updated in Store() command.
+ Added example for creating mountains in terrain.xml
+ Added code to for mountain generation with MM RMG
+ BUG: units added via SHouse.tick() and Market2.tick() where sent to the
  players before the tickThread sent CC|NT|. Now all min sales are incremented
  by 1 to offset this issue.
+ BUG: Login CC|NT| decremented BM sales ticks.
+ BUG: Sold units where being removed directly from the Auction TreeMap causing
  a concurrent modification error. 
+ BUG: ShortResolver.selectRandomLoser() would select winners.firstKey() if
  only 1 loser existed. Cut&Paste God strikes again!
+ BUG: mmconf folder not created when pulling gameoptions.xml from the server
  this is use by both MM and MW. MM will create it once a game is launched;
  however, it is needed much sooner.
+ BUG: ConcurrentMod Error in market2.tick()
+ BUG: Timestamp client side was getting set before the PDiff command was being
  sent. This caused planet updates to never happen.
R Client/Server 0.1.35.0
+ BUG: SPlanet.sendHouseStatusUpdate() did not take into account planets with
  no clear owners.
+ Made some additional SUnit methods static (getHangarSpaceRequired,
  getMapSizeModification) static. Moved getRandomPilotName to SPilot.
- Removed server.comm.*  and moved commands into MWChatServer.commands.*
+ Less redundant code in Market2.tick, removeListing, and removeAllListings. 
+ BUG: Removing units from SHouse, instead of sending a removal command to the
  clients, when adding faction unit to BM.
- Removed UPDATEMESSAGE from serverconfig. Mooted by MekWarsAutoUpdater.
- Removed HelpCommand.java and updated default severconfig.txt
+ Don't send PMs, HM's, MM's, and RP messages that are only spaces.
- Turned off debugging messages client side for inflation.
+ Server now sends both compressed data size and uncompressed data size in the
  /deflate command. This allows the client to create a byte array big enough to
  hold all of the server data, This should prevent the issue that TT caused
  with its massive data! This also causes a break in the communications
  protocol and requires a new REV.

v 0.1.34.x (Closed 6.12.06. No SF Release)
R Server 0.1.34.2
+ Changed the byte array length for _deflation to that of the length of the
  string s instead of guessing with static variables.
+ BUG: Units put on the market by factions, or as rares, were not updating
  clients propelry on removal.
+ BUG: Market2.addListing(String, SUnit, int, int) did not check to see if 
  unit was being added by a faction, caused annoying error messages.
+ Added new MegaMek.jar file 0.31.9-MW6122006
+ R Client 0.1.34.1 / Server 0.1.34.1

  defaults. Best practice is for ops to hand edit the file and confirm changes.
+ Some tweaks to AdminLockFactory and RefreshFactory, so they refresh HS.
+ HouseStatus tab now receives automatic, incremental updates from server. This
  required signficant rewrites of portions of CHSPanel, SHouse, and HS.java, as

- Removed SHouse.setPP(). Was unused.

  utility used before the in-client map was coded.
