How to convert an existing set of planet.dat files to the new 0.4.x.x format

1) download newest code, change to the main directory
2) from a command prompt run:ant clean
3) from a command prompt run:ant PlanetDatConverter-jar
4) from a command prompt run:ant server-jar
5) copy PlanetDatConverter.jar to your servers running directory
6) copy advTerr.xml and advTerr.dtd to the /data directory of your running server
7) from your server working directory run: java -jar PlanetDatConverter.jar
8) there should now be a new folder named "./campaign/newplanets/" where the new planet.dat files have been copied
9) check that your planets are in that new folder
10) move the old ./campaign/planets floder to a new name (I like ./campaign/oldplanets) then move the ./campaign/newplanets folder to ./campaign/planets 
11) move the rest of the server jars over to the servers working directory
12) you should be able to start the server now and it should load all the planets correctly.
