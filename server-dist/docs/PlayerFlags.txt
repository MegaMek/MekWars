Using Player Flags in operations

Creating Flags:
  This should be done through the admin interface, under server
  configs.
  
  Do not use spaces, #, or $ in your flag names
  
Assigning flags in Operations
  The OpEditor now has a new tab for Player Flags.  Here, you can
  require certain combinations of flags and settings for both
  the attacker and/or the defender.  There are also two tables for
  setting winner/loser flags.  Here, you can set flags based on
  a winning/losing attacker/defender
  
  Right/click to add/delete a flag from any of the 4 tables
  
Remember, please, that as with any new feature, feedback is important.
If there are issues, and I'd be surprised if there were not, please
submit a bug report.
