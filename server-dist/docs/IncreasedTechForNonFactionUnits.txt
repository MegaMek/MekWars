How to enable Non-Faction Units costing more techs

Server Configuration
	- In the Advanced Repairs tab, select "Use Techs" and check "Non-Faction Units cost extra techs"
	- In the Techs tab, enter a value in the "Non-House Unit Increased Techs" field.
		- This is a multiplier, so if you have medium mechs costing 4 techs, and want non-house units to cost 6, enter 1.5 in this field

File System
	- Create a directory under ./campaign/factions called "support"
	- The ./campaign/factions/support directory will be where you store your supported units files
	
Support files
	- For any units that are to be considered supported for all factions, create a file called common_meks.txt and fill it with the required data
	- Do the same for common_vehicles.txt, common_infantry.txt, common_battlearmor.txt, and common_protomeks.txt
	- For each faction, create files called [House Name]_weightclass_unittype.txt
		- For example, for house Davion, you'd have:
			Davion_light_meks.txt
			Davion_medium_meks.txt
			Davion_heavy_meks.txt
			Davion_assault_meks.txt
			Davion_light_vehicles.txt
			Davion_medium_vehicles.txt
				- etc
			Davion_light_infantry.txt
				- etc.
			Davion_light_battlearmor.txt
				- etc.
			Davion_light_protomeks.txt
				- etc.
		- The house name must be exactly as it is in the Server, including spaces and capitalization
	- In the support files, units are laid out one-per-line, with no file extension
		- Just lop the file extension off the name of the file
			- So, if your build tables contain "Catapult CPLT-C4.mtf", you'd enter "Catapult CPLT-C4" on one line
			- An example, on my local server, for the Capellan Confederation heavy mechs:
				- Capellan Confederation_heavy_mek.txt:
					Ostroc OSR-2L
					Catapult CPLT-A1
					Catapult CPLT-C1
					Catapult CPLT-C4
					Crusader CRD-3L
					Jagermech JM6-S
					Thunderbolt TDR-5S
					Archer ARC-2R
					Cataphract CTF-1X
					Cataphract CTF-2X
					Warhammer WHM-6L
					Marauder MAD-3L
